Treatments include medication, psychotherapy, education or training, or a combination of treatments. 
Consider non-pharmacological treatment for adults with ADHD who have:
made an informed choice not to have medication
difficulty adhering to medication
found medication to be ineffective or cannot tolerate it.
Consider non-pharmacological treatment in combination with medication for adults with ADHD who have benefited from medication but whose symptoms are still causing a significant impairment in at least one domain. 
When non-pharmacological treatment is indicated for adults with ADHD, offer the following as a minimum:
a structured supportive psychological intervention focused on ADHD
regular follow-up either in person or by phone.

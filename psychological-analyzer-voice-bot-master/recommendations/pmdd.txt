Modify your diet
Eat smaller, more-frequent meals to reduce bloating and the sensation of fullness.
Limit salt and salty foods to reduce bloating and fluid retention.
Choose foods high in complex carbohydrates, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
Choose foods rich in calcium. If you can't tolerate dairy products or aren't getting adequate calcium in your diet, a daily calcium supplement may help.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.
Incorporate exercise into your regular routine
Engage in at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, cycling, swimming or other aerobic activity most days of the week. Regular daily exercise can help improve your overall health and alleviate certain symptoms, such as fatigue and a depressed mood.
Reduce stress
Get plenty of sleep.
Practice progressive muscle relaxation or deep-breathing exercises to help reduce headaches, anxiety or trouble sleeping (insomnia).
Try yoga or massage to relax and relieve stress.
